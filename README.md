Goal: Upload a solution to a database query problem. Solutions are written in PostgreSQL and Python.

## Task 1

Write a query that calculates the difference between the highest salaries found in the marketing and engineering departments. Output just the difference in salaries.

## Task 2

We have a table with employees and their salaries, however, some of the records are old and contain outdated salary information. Find the current salary of each employee assuming that salaries increase each year. Output their id, first name, last name, department ID, and current salary. Order your list by employee ID in ascending order.

## Task 3

Find the average number of bathrooms and bedrooms for each cityâ€™s property types. Output the result along with the city name and the property type.

## Task 4

Find the details of each customer regardless of whether the customer made an order. Output the customer's first name, last name, and the city along with the order details. You may have duplicate rows in your results due to a customer ordering several of the same items. Sort records based on the customer's first name and the order details in ascending order.
